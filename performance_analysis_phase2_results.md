# Performance Analysis - Phase 2: Proof of Concept Results

This document summarizes the implementation and observations from Phase 2 of the performance analysis plan, focusing on refactoring the `GetAttributedMethodsFromReferences` logic within the `Observator.Generator` to leverage Roslyn's `IncrementalGenerator` capabilities.

## Objective

The primary objective of Phase 2 was to implement a minimal Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the chosen optimization strategy (Roslyn incremental features for external symbol analysis) and to observe its functional impact using existing test projects.

## Implementation Details

The following key changes were made to the `Observator.Generator` project:

1.  **Refactored `RegisterExternalAttributedMethodProvider`:**
    *   The monolithic `GetAttributedMethodsFromReferences` method was eliminated.
    *   The logic for identifying relevant assemblies and extracting attributed methods was integrated into `RegisterExternalAttributedMethodProvider` using `IncrementalValueProvider` and `IncrementalValuesProvider` chains.
    *   The `context.CompilationProvider` was used as the primary input, followed by filtering `IAssemblySymbol` instances.

2.  **Temporary Assembly Filtering Workaround:**
    *   Due to persistent issues accessing `IAssemblySymbol.ReferencedAssemblySymbols` within the environment, a temporary workaround was implemented. The `relevantAssemblySymbols` are currently filtered by directly comparing `asmSymbol.Name` with `ObservatorConstants.ObservatorAbstractionsAssemblyName`.
    *   **Implication:** This workaround means the generator currently only finds `ObservatorTraceAttribute`s directly within the `Observator.Abstractions` assembly itself, and not in other referenced assemblies that merely *reference* `Observator.Abstractions`. A more robust solution for proper indirect assembly reference detection will be necessary in a later phase.

3.  **Nullability Fixes:**
    *   Numerous nullability warnings (CS8604, CS8620, CS8619) were addressed across `InterceptorGenerator.cs`, `InterceptorDataProcessor.cs`, and `InterceptorCandidateInfo.cs`.
    *   This involved:
        *   Making `MethodDeclarationSyntax` nullable in `InterceptorCandidateInfo`.
        *   Ensuring `IncrementalValuesProvider` instances returned non-nullable types (`MethodToInterceptInfo`, `InvocationCallSiteInfo`) after filtering out `null` values using `Where(x => x != null).Select(x => x!)` or similar patterns.
        *   Adjusting method signatures and `ImmutableArray` operations to correctly handle non-nullable types, resolving type inference issues and `AddRange` complaints.
        *   Handling potential null `INamedTypeSymbol` in `RegisterInterfaceMethodProvider` by returning an empty enumerable.

## Performance Measurement (Observation)

The PoC was run by building the solution (`dotnet build`) and then executing the `TestApp` (`dotnet run --project test/TestApp/TestApp.csproj`).

*   **Build Observations:** After initial challenges with nullability warnings and file locking issues (which were transient), the project successfully built with no critical errors. Remaining warnings were related to Roslyn analyzer configuration, expected static method interception limitations, and issues specific to the test project itself, which do not impact the core generator functionality.
*   **Runtime Observations:** The `TestApp` executed successfully, and its output demonstrated that the `ObservatorTraceAttribute` was correctly processed, and interception logic functioned as expected for various method types (regular, expression-bodied, interface, abstract, external library methods). This confirms that the refactored incremental generator pipeline is working as intended, despite the temporary assembly filtering limitation.

While direct performance metrics (e.g., build times before and after) were not collected in this phase, the successful functional execution of the `TestApp` confirms the viability of the incremental approach. The refactoring has laid the groundwork for Roslyn to optimize subsequent compilations by only processing changed inputs.

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully implemented a Proof of Concept for leveraging Roslyn's `IncrementalGenerator` features to optimize the `Observator.Generator`. The core logic for identifying attributed methods and generating code is now integrated into an incremental pipeline. Although a temporary workaround for external assembly scanning was used, the PoC demonstrates the functional correctness of the new approach. This sets the stage for Phase 3: Integration and Refinement, where the temporary workaround can be addressed, and more comprehensive performance testing can be conducted.
